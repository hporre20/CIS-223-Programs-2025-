                                <p> Besides the main two mentioned on the home page, you will analyze real world computational
                                    problems as Boolean systems, create code to check sytax and range values to 
                                    validate user input, analyze code and check the results of computations returned by the code. </p>

                                <p> Since this course is an online program, it is at your discretion to do the class work, watch the video lectures, and respond 
                                    to discussions before the due date each week. The modules are posted right before the start date each week to give ample time to 
                                    finish each objective or project. </p>

                            <h3 class="FAQs"> How are homework and projects graded? </h3>
                                <p> Online quizzes are automatically graded and can be attempted multiple times. Discussions are graded 
                                    based on criteria in the description at the top of the submission page. Projects and programs have a rubric on the module page, available
                                    through the submission portion for the week the project or program is due. </p>

                                <p> It is important to understand how HTML works, as you will need to use it for this class. CSS is not necessarily needed, but does add 
                                    to the appearance of pages and programs. </p>
